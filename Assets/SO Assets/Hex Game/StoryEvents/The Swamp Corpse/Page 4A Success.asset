  pageDescription: "With no longer any need to be quiet, you yell out to {CHARACTER_1_NAME}
    {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} to quickly snatch the helmet and run like the wind. Still
    flat on his back from the fall, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} rolls
    over and crawls through the mud to the corpse. As he fumbles with getting the
    chin strap undone, the ground quakes harder and harder, and the terrifying roars
    become so loud you wonder if they'll hear it all the way back at Ulwfe. \n\nAfter
    an excrutiatingly long time, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} finally
    relieves the dead man of his helmet, jumps to his feet, and runs back towards
    you through the swamp, nearly slipping and falling with every step. From dry
    ground, you grab his hand and yank him out faster, then turn and run without
    looking back. You don't know what was coming after you, and you don't need to
    know. What you do know is that you got the gold, the axe, and the helmet, and
    that's what matters...apparently...\n"
