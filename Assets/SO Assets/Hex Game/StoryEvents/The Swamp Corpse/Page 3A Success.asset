  pageDescription: "Being careful not to make any noise, you point towards the axe
    in the tree and soundlessly mouth out at {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME}
    <color=#FFFFFF>\"Get, the, axe... get, the, axe...\".</color> {CHARACTER_1_NAME}
    {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} stares at you with blankly for a few moments, glances
    over his shoulder towards where you're pointing, then looks back at you with
    the same glazed look of stupidity. After a pause, the message finally gets through.
    A grin washes over his face and he silently mouthes back at you <color=#FFFFFF>\"Oooooh,
    the axe!\".</color>\n\n{CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} tiptoes over
    to the tree, places both hands firmly on the handle of the axe, and begins tugging
    away to no effect. He places a foot against the base of the tree, and with a
    few more tugs the axe comes loose, sending {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME}
    flying over and backwards onto the ground with a loud thud and groan. \n\nA deep,
    rumbling roar resonates out from the trees. The ground begins to quake and tremble
    to the pace of foot steps approaching. \n\nThe corpse's body armour is chewed
    up good and proper, but the helmet looks to be intact. You could try and take
    it quickly, but something wicked this way comes..."
