  pageDescription: "Delighted by your expression of interest, the hooded figure's
    impossibly wide grin grows even wider. More dark smoke billows out from his robe
    to form his left hand stretching out towards you. Smoky fingers uncurl to reveal
    a perfectly cut red gem with a gently oscilating glow. \n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"The
    crystallized spirit of a king's jealous concubine that lived long before the
    rise of the Imperium. Perhaps, even before my time.  He who posseses this shall
    have their sword arm fueled by the envious rage of a lover's scorn.\"</color>\n\nSmoke
    evaporates from the robes to form an arm once more, revealing a fairly unremarkable
    looking rock.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"No exciting mystery to go along with this one
    i'm afraid, 'tis simply a petrified wyrm egg. So well documented are it's properites
    that even that insufferable simpleton at the library will tell you the same as
    I: standing near this egg will harden one's flesh to cuts\".</color>\n\nThe hooded
    figure pauses, slowly redirects it's maniacal gaze back towards you and leans
    inward with a tilted head.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Choose\".</color>"
