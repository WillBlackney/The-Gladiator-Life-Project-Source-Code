  pageDescription: "While laying down in the bed of your tavern room after a long
    day of sending people to their deaths, a horrid smell wafts through the air as
    a cold chill fills the room. Sitting up, you notice plumes of thick black smoke
    pooling in from the walls around you, and watch as it coalesces in the center
    of the room to form of hooded and cloaked figure. From under it's hood you see
    two red dots for eyes and a wide, wicked grin. \n\nYou grab the blade from underneath
    your bed to ready yourself, but as soon as you do the hooded figure outstrecthes
    his hand, and suddenly the handle of the blade burns so hot you're forced to
    drop it, wincing in pain. \n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Steady on, captain. If I wanted
    you dead, i'd have just waited for you to fall asleep, then eaten your kidneys.
    Besides, i simply came to make you an offer on behalf of my...employer, for lack
    of a better term\".</color>"
