  pageDescription: "With no longer any need to be quiet, you yell out to {CHARACTER_1_NAME}
    {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} to quickly snatch the helmet and run like the wind. Still
    flat on his back from the fall, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} rolls over and crawls through
    the mud to the corpse. As he fumbles with getting the chin strap undone, the
    ground quakes harder and harder, and the terrifying roars become so loud you
    wonder if they'll hear it all the way back at Ulwfe. \n\nAfter an excrutiatingly
    long time, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} finally relieves the dead man of his helmet, jumps
    to his feet, and runs back towards you through the swamp, nearly slipping and
    falling with every step. From dry ground, you grab his hand and yank him out
    faster, then turn and run without looking back. You got the gold, the axe, and
    the helmet, and that's what matters...apparently...\n"
