  pageDescription: "Being careful not to make any noise, you point towards the axe
    in the tree and soundlessly mouth out at {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME}
    <color=#FFFFFF>\"Get, the, axe... get, the, axe...\".</color> {CHARACTER_1_NAME}
    {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} stares at you with blankly for a few moments, glances
    over his shoulder towards where you're pointing, then looks back at you with
    the same glazed look of stupidity. After a pause, the message finally gets through.
    A grin washes over his face and he silently mouthes back at you <color=#FFFFFF>\"Oooooh,
    the axe!\".</color>\r\n\r\n{CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} tiptoes
    over to the tree, places both hands firmly on the handle of the axe, and begins
    tugging away to no effect. He places a foot against the base of the tree, and
    with a few more tugs the axe comes loose, sending {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME}
    flying over and backwards onto the ground with a loud thud and groan. \r\n\r\nA
    low, guttural growl reverberates through the forest. Instinctively, you both
    freeze, eyes darting around to locate the source of the sound. After a tense
    silence, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} lets out a sigh of relief, when suddenly\u2026\r\n\r\nA
    huge, scaley, bipedal swamp monster emerges from the tree line with a roar. The
    beast sprints towards {CHARACTER_1_NAME} at lightning speed and tackles him to
    the ground. After a furious flurry of claws and bites, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} is
    a bloody mess, indistinguishable from the corpse he just looted. Perhaps content
    with it\u2019s previous meal, the blood drenched beast ends its mauling prematurely,
    grabs {CHARACTER_1_NAME}'s lifeless corpse by the feet, then turns and walks
    away into the depths of the forest trees dragging {CHARACTER_1_NAME} behind him,
    never to be seen again\u2026\r"
