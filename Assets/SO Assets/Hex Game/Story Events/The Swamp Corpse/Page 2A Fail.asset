  pageDescription: "After a quick glance around, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME}
    tiptoes through the shallow swampy waters over to the dead guard. Neglecting
    to watch his step, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} treads on a fallen branch, breaking the
    eerie swamp silence with a definitive crunch. A low, guttural growl reverberates
    through the forest. Instinctively, you both freeze, eyes darting around to locate
    the source of the sound. After a tense silence, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} lets out a
    sigh of relief, when suddenly\u2026\r\n\r\nA huge, scaley, bipedal swamp monster
    emerges from the tree line with a roar. The beast sprints towards {CHARACTER_1_NAME}
    at lightning speed and tackles him to the ground. After a furious flurry of claws
    and bites, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} is a bloody mess, indistinguishable from the corpse
    he just looted. Perhaps content with it\u2019s previous meal, the blood drenched
    beast ends its mauling prematurely, grabs {CHARACTER_1_NAME}'s lifeless corpse
    by the feet, then turns and walks away into the depths of the forest trees dragging
    {CHARACTER_1_NAME} behind him, never to be seen again\u2026\r\n"
