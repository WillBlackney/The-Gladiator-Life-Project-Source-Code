  pageDescription: "Keen to be rid of your uninvited guest, you point to the object
    in the hooded figure's left hand without dwelling too much on the decision. \n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Very
    well, mortal. A fair trade.\"</color> says the hooded figure, leaning back and
    placing the other object back inside his cloak.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Trade?\"</color>
    you ask suspiciously with an eye brow raised.\n\nThe hooded figure tilts its
    head back and cackles menancingly for a moment before rapidly evaporating into
    black smoke so thick it fills the room, preventing you from seeing anything beyond
    your nose. After the smoke clears enough, you see the object glowing gently from
    the floor, right were the hooded figure once stood. You also notice your knap
    sack open with a big empty space were all your gold used to be...Demonic bastard
    stole all the money!"
