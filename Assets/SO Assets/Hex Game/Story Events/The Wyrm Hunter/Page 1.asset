  pageDescription: 'Fresh off the heels of an arena victory, you head to the tavern
    with the men to celebrate and relax. The atmosphere in the tavern is euphoric
    and wild. The locals are thrilled from the day''s gladiatorial extravaganza,
    and your men joke and jest in good spirits with patrons who toast them by buying
    them round after round.


    The euphoria comes to an abrupt pause as the tavern
    door screeches open quickly and bangs loudly against the wall at the end of it''s
    opening swing. An intimidatingly large Orc stands boldly at the door frame, his
    gaze slowly moving across the room in search of something or someone. Eventually
    the orc''s gaze meets your own, and his tusked frown grows into a wide eyed smile.
    His floor groans loudly as he stomps over to your table and takes a seat across
    from you.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"I, am Gromak The Great!"</color>, he declares
    with a prideful smile and bouncing eyebrows, clearly expecting you to know who
    that is and be impressed.'
