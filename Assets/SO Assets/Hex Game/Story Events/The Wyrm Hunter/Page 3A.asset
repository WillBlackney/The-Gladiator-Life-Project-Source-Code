  pageDescription: "Big muscles, big tusks, and a big ego: the ideal qualities of
    a gladiator. You accept Gormak's offer, tossing him a bag of coins as his signing
    fee and sliding a mug of ale towards him. He snatches the mug before it slides
    to a stop and chugs it down quickly, ale spilling all down his face and armour.
    He lets out a long <color=#FFFFFF>\"Ahhhhh\"</color> as he slams the empty mug
    onto the table.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Lok' narosh, captain. Lok' narosh! Now, let's
    establish proper etiquette, eh? First, you and your men shall address me as 'Gormak
    the Great' or 'Sir Gormak', and only ever these two, espicially when discussing
    my great deeds with others. 'Gormak the God' is also acceptable. \n\nSecond,
    who is the one that shall clean my armour at the end of each day? Will it be
    you? Actually nevermind, I'll just get the squire you assign to me to do it.
    Third, i require a foot massage at the end of each day, performed by a female
    satyr no older than 21 summers. I'll also require someone to carry my baggage.
    Fourth...\".</color>\n\nOne by one, you and the men stop paying attention and
    go back to drinking and joking. Gormak, clearly in love with the sound of his
    own voice, doesn't even notice."
