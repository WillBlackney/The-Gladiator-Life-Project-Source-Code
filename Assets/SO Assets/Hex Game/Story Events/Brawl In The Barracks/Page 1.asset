  pageDescription: While taking count of inventory, you hear a commotion slowly grow
    louder and louder from within the barracks. You got to investigate and see {CHARACTER_1_NAME}
    {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} and {CHARACTER_2_NAME} {CHARACTER_2_SUB_NAME} gripping
    each other by their collars with both hands, foreheads touching with locked eyes
    exchanging profanities and insults. The rest of the men, clearly entertained
    by the commotion, stand all around jeering enthusiaically in an attempt to egg
    the two on to exchange blows. Eventually the men notice you've entered the room
    and grow quiet, awaiting you're approval or intervention...
