  bodyText: "Breedmarsh is as grim as the name suggests. An awesome and disgusting
    network of intestine-like walkways, cobbled together from roots and vines. The
    buildings drip with mire from the marsh below. Yet despite the muck, there's
    an elusive charm to the place.\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive at the tavern, you don't
    get a chance to enter before a pair of bodies tumble out the door. One fighter's
    tooth bounces past your shoe and into the murky bog water below. The grappling
    duo unclinch and scramble to their feet. One of them, an monsterously large human
    lumberjack, picks up a nearby broom and stands menacingly over his opponent:
    a tiny, but vicious looking goblin thief. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CHey! No
    fair.\u201D</color> Says the goblin. <color=#FFFFFF>\u201CThis is a friendly
    brawl, no weapons allowed.\u201D</color>\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF> \u201CYou pinched
    my nipple, you green little RAT!\u201D</color> the red-faced lumberjack bellows
    back. You swear you see his iron grip begin to splinter the wood of the broom.\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CAnd
    i would again, fatty! Come at me once more, and that nipple will belong to me!\u201D</color>
    \r\n\r\nAs the goblin eyes dart around looking for something sharp or heavy to
    use as a weapon, he notices you and the kid staring.\r\n\r\nThe Nipple Pincher
    turns to you and The Kid. <color=#FFFFFF>\u201COi, you two! What do you reckon?
    Should we be allowed weapons or not?\u201D</color>"
