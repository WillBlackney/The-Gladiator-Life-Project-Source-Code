  bodyText: "The murky town of Breedmarsh emerges through dense bogland. Mud-soaked
    palisades rise up between craggy, twisted trees. A brightly dressed town guard
    ushers you closer to the gate as you arrive.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Welcome
    weary traveller! And what a jubilant afternoon might I add! May I ask reason
    for entering?\"</color> He says. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve never been in a drearier
    place. With a sigh, you and the Kid look to one another. If you told the guard
    about <i>the plan</i> you\u2019d be executed on the spot.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"We're
    here for the tournament.\"</color> Says the Kid. He doesn't lie, but smartly
    he doesn't tell the whole truth.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Oh, jolly! Blood for
    the blood god!\"</color> Announces the guard, clapping in jubilation. <color=#FFFFFF>\"You'll
    require at least 3 reliable fighters to enter. If you\u2019re in need, our excellent
    tavern is sure to provide you with stalwart comrades!\"</color>"
