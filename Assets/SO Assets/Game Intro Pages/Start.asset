  bodyText: "The murky town of Breedmarsh emerges through dense bogland. Mud-soaked
    palisades rise up between craggy, twisted trees. A brightly dressed town guard
    ushers you closer to the gate as you arrive.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CWelcome
    weary traveller! And what a jubilant afternoon might I add! May I ask reason
    for entering?\u201D</color> He says. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve never been in a drearier
    place. With a sigh, you and the Kid look to one another. If you told the guard
    about \u2018the plan\u2019 you\u2019d be executed on the spot.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CWe\u2019re
    here for the tournament.\u201D</color> Says the Kid. He doesn\u2019t lie, but
    smartly he doesn\u2019t tell the whole truth.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201COh,
    jolly! Blood for the blood god!\u201D</color> Announces the guard, clapping in
    jubilation. <color=#FFFFFF>\u201CYou\u2019ll require at least 3 reliable fighters
    to enter. If you\u2019re in need, our excellent tavern is sure to provide you
    with stalwart comrades!\u201D</color>"
