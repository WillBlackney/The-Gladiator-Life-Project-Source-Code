  bodyText: "Breedmarsh is as grim as the name suggests. An awesome and disgusting
    network of intestine-like walkways, cobbled together from roots and vines. The
    buildings drip with mire from the marsh below. Yet despite the muck, there's
    an elusive charm to the place.\r\n\r\nUpon your arrival at the tavern, a lively
    commotion spills out the door. Two figures tumble into view. One fighter's tooth
    bounces past your shoe and into the murky bog water below. The grappling duo
    unclinch and scramble to their feet. One of them, a monstrously large human lumberjack,
    stands imposingly over the other, an orc soldier, wearing the purple of the empire.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CThought
    you'd piss in my drink and i wouldn't notice?! Apologize, then go buy me another!
    Or how about i make you drink it?\u201D</color> the orc huffs and puffs as he
    points his finger up at the lumberjack's face. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201COk.
    I'll apologize. I'm sorry you're a traitorous, imperial bootlicker.\u201D</color>
    the lumberjack roars.\r\n\r\nThe two widen their fighting stances, ready to re-engage.
    You sense an opportunity to intervene before the two fools kill each other."
