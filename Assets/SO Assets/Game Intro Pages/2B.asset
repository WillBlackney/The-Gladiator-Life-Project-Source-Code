  bodyText: "Breedmarsh is as grim as the name suggests. An awesome and disgusting
    network of intestine-like walkways, cobbled together from roots and vines. The
    buildings drip with mire from the marsh below. Yet despite the muck, there's
    an elusive charm to the place.\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive at the tavern, you don\u2019t
    get a chance to enter before a pair of bodies tumble out the door. One fighter's
    tooth bounces past your shoe and into the murky bog water below. The grappling
    duo unclinch and scramble to their feet. One of them, an orc from the local militia,
    the other, a monstrously large human lumberjack. \r\n\r\nUpon your arrival at
    the tavern, you're halted in your tracks by a peculiar spectacle. A lively commotion
    spills out the tavern door, and two figures tumble into view. A tooth from one
    of the fighters bounces carelessly past your shoe, landing in the murky bog water.
    The grappling pair disentangle themselves and swiftly regain their footing. One
    of them, a monstrously large human lumberjack, stands imposingly over the other,
    an orc from the local militia. \n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CThought you'd scull my
    drink and i wouldn't notice?! Apologize, then go buy me another!\u201D</color>
    the orc huffs and puffs as he points his finger up at the lumberjacks face. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201COk.
    I'll apologize. I'm sorry you're a traitorous, imperial bootlicker.\u201D</color>
    the lumberjack retorts back in a manner that makes you think this may be a little
    more personal to him than a random bar brawl ought to be. \r\n\r\nThe two widen
    their bases and prime themselves to re-engage. You sense an opportunity to intervene
    before the two fools kill each other."
