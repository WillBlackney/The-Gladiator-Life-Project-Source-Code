    something smash outside. You grab your newest recruit and leave the tavern. You
    see The Kid lying in the mud stunned with a shield, and the orc militiaman standing
    over him. The militiaman calmly kneels down and helps the kid back up his feet,
    then dusts him off gently. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Not bad, kid. Remember to
    keep your shield up next time, eh?\"</color> the orc says gently. The kid, still
    a bit disoriented, smiles and nods enthusiastically."
