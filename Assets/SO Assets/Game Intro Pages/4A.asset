  bodyText: "Inside the tavern is crowded, and warm. The bouncer, a Satyr, uses an
    arcane spell to eject a trio of rowdy patrons, an Orc beats out a breakneck rhythm
    on a collection of skulls, logs, and skin drums, and an elf dazzles a table with
    magic card tricks. The enchanted cards race around the room, multiplying, disappearing,
    and instilling awe in all who look on. \r\n\r\nAs you survey the room, you notice
    two patrons sitting quietly in the corner of the room. One of them, an satyr
    poacher in green robes, nurses a drink while staring intently at a board game
    infront of him. The other, a skeletal witch shrouded in black robes, beckons
    you over with a curling bony finger gesture. As you approach the table, the skeleton
    grins and pulls out a chair for you.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"I've no interest
    in small talk human. I heard you and the morons out front talk of forming a team.
    We want in. I'm more than capable of wielding dark magic when it suits it me.
    And this handsome archer here? Well...let's just say that IF he was a bad shot,
    i'd still have my skin.\"</color>"
