  bodyText: "Breedmarsh is as grim as the name suggests. An awesome and disgusting
    network of intestine-like walkways, cobbled together from roots and vines. The
    buildings drip with mire from the marsh below. Yet despite the muck, there's
    an elusive charm to the place.\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive at the tavern, you don\u2019t
    get a chance to enter before a pair of bodies tumble out the door. One fighter's
    tooth bounces past your shoe and into the murky bog water below. The grappling
    duo unclinch and scramble to their feet. One of them, an orc militiaman, picks
    up a nearby bottle and stands menacingly over his opponent: a tiny, but vicious
    looking goblin thief. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Hey! No fair.\"</color> Says the
    goblin. <color=#FFFFFF>\"This is a friendly brawl, no weapons allowed.\"</color>\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>
    \"You pinched my nipple, you green little RAT!\"</color> the orc bellows back.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"And
    i would again, you big oaf! Come at me once more, and that nipple will belong
    to me!\"</color> \r\n\r\nAs the goblin eyes dart around looking for something
    sharp or heavy to use as a weapon, he notices you and the kid staring.\r\n\r\nThe
    Nipple Pincher turns to you and The Kid. <color=#FFFFFF>\"Oi, you two! What do
    you reckon? Should we be allowed weapons or not?\"</color>"
