  bodyText: "Breedmarsh is as grim as the name suggests. An awesome and disgusting
    network of intestine-like walkways, cobbled together from roots and vines. The
    buildings drip with mire from the marsh below. Yet despite the muck, there's
    an elusive charm to the place.\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive at the tavern, you don\u2019t
    get a chance to enter before a pair of bodies tumble out the door. One fighter's
    tooth bounces past your shoe and into the murky bog water below. The grappling
    duo unclinch and scramble to their feet. One of them, an orc from the local militia,
    picks up a nearby bottle and stands menacingly over his opponent: a tiny, but
    vicious looking goblin thief. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CHey! No fair.\u201D</color>
    Says the goblin. <color=#FFFFFF>\u201CThis is a friendly brawl, no weapons allowed.\u201D</color>\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>
    \u201CYou pinched my nipple, you green little RAT!\u201D</color> the orc bellows
    back.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CAnd i would again, you big oaf! Come at me
    once more, and that nipple will belong to me!\u201D</color> \r\n\r\nAs the goblin
    eyes dart around looking for something sharp or heavy to use as a weapon, he
    notices you and the kid staring.\r\n\r\nThe Nipple Pincher turns to you and The
    Kid. <color=#FFFFFF>\u201COi, you two! What do you reckon? Should we be allowed
    weapons or not?\u201D</color>"
