  bodyText: "Inside the tavern is crowded, and warm. The bouncer, a Satyr, uses an
    arcane spell to eject a trio of rowdy patrons, an Orc beats out a breakneck rhythm
    on a collection of skulls, logs, and skin drums, and an elf dazzles a table with
    magic card tricks. The enchanted cards race around the room, multiplying, disappearing,
    and instilling awe in all who look on. \r\n\r\nAs you survey the room, you notice
    two patrons sitting quietly in the corner of the room. One of them, an elf scholar
    in blue robes, nurses a drink while staring intently at a board game infront
    of her. The other, a skeletal witch shrouded in black robes, beckons you over
    with a curling bony finger gesture. As you approach the table, the skeleton grins
    and pulls out a chair for you.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"I've no interest in small
    talk human. I heard you and the morons out front talk of forming a team. We want
    in. I'm more than capable of wielding dark magic when it suits it me. And this
    seductive sorceress here? Well...let's just say that IF she wasn't so skilled
    in pyrokinetics, i'd still have my skin.\"</color>\n\r\nA tempting proposal indeed,
    but you've enough room in the budget for one of them..."
