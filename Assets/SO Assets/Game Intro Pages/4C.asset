  bodyText: "You enter the crowded tavern. The bouncer, a satyr, uses an arcane spell
    to eject a trio of rowdy patrons, an gnoll beats out a breakneck rhythm on a
    collection of skulls, logs, and skin drums, and an elf dazzles a table with magic
    card tricks. The enchanted cards race around the room, multiplying, disappearing,
    and instilling awe in all who look on. \r\n\nYou notice a peculiar pair seated
    in the corner of the room. One of them, an elf scholar drains her drink, staring
    through her drunken haze at the board game infront of her. The other, an undead
    witch shrouded in black robes, beckons you over with a curling finger. As you
    approach the gnoll grins.\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"I've no interest in small talk.
    I heard you and the morons out front talk of forming a team. We want in. I'm
    more than capable of wielding old magic when it suits it me. And this, drunken
    seductress here also happens to be the most creative sadist with a wand this
    side of the capital.\"</color>"
