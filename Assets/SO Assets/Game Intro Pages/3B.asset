  bodyText: "The broom wielder sighs. He turns to place the broom against the tavern
    wall. As soon as his back is turned, the Nipple Pincher barges him off the platform.
    The broom wielder falls into the marshy water below while clutching his nipples
    and screaming.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"How did you bull rush that guy AND pinch
    his nipples at the same time?\"</color> Asks The Kid as he stares off the edge
    of the platform.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"I'm very good with my fingers. I could
    teach you?\"</color> The Nipple Pincher brags, wiggling his digits. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"You
    two aren\u2019t putting a crew together for the Arena are you? I like it when
    people take my side.\"</color>\r\n\r\nThe Kid looks at the goblin then back to
    you with a look that says: 'can we keep him?'"
