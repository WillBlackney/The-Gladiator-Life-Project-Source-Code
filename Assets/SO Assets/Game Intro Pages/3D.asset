  bodyText: "You've something of a score to settle with the imperium yourself, so
    you decide to throw a nearby broom towards the lumberjack to hit the militiaman
    with. Unfortunately your aim is a bit off, and the militiaman snaps up the broom
    mid air, then brings it down hard on the lumberjack's head, knocking him down
    and out in a one swift movement. The miltiaman drops the broken broom and dusts
    off his hands.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\u201CThanks, old timer. You're looking
    for arena fighters, aren't you?\u201D</color> He asks."
