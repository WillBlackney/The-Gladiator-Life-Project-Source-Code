  bodyText: 'You quickly grab another fighter to add to your roster, then realize
    The Kid is nowhere to be seen. After a moment of panic, you hear the sound of
    a swelling chant outside. You grab your newest recruit and leave the tavern.
    A small crowd surrounds The Kid chanting "Down! Down! Down!" as the The Kid tries
    his hardest to scull a bucket of ale big than himself. The Kid finally knocks
    it back, drops the bucket at his feet, then flexes his biceps above his head
    to the applause of the crowd. He notices you''ve retuned and flashes you a wide
    green.
