  bodyText: "You enter the crowded tavern. The bouncer, a satyr, uses an arcane spell
    to eject a trio of rowdy patrons, an gnoll beats out a breakneck rhythm on a
    collection of skulls, logs, and skin drums, and an elf dazzles a table with magic
    card tricks. The enchanted cards race around the room, multiplying, disappearing,
    and instilling awe in all who look on.\n\nYou notice a peculiar pair seated in
    the corner of the room. A demure satyr poacher nurses a drink while staring intently
    at a board game. The other, an elf scholar in blue robes beckons you over with
    a seductive 'come hither' gesture. As you approach the elf reclines, smiling
    flirtatiously.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Hello handsome! Are you new here? I couldn't
    help but overhear that you're putting a team together. I'd just love for us to
    get better acquaninted. You can believe me when I say we're worth it?\"</color>
    the elf flutters her eyelashes and twirls a finger through her hair. The satyr
    smirks, struggling to contain her laughter at the elfs drunken flirtation. The
    elf continues, oblivious. \n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"I perfected a brand new spell
    the other day. Almost turned a gnoll completely inside out with it! And Pretty
    here, she's the best archer in all the empire. I once saw her shoot the hair
    off a spider's arse while drunk!\"</color>"
