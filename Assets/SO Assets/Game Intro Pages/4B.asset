  bodyText: "Inside the tavern is crowded, and warm. The bouncer, a Satyr, uses an
    arcane spell to eject a trio of rowdy patrons, an Orc beats out a breakneck rhythm
    on a collection of skulls, logs, and skin drums, and an elf dazzles a table with
    magic card tricks. The enchanted cards race around the room, multiplying, disappearing,
    and instilling awe in all who look on. \r\n\r\nAs you survey the room, you notice
    two patrons sitting quietly in the corner of the room. One of them, an satyr
    poacher in green robes, nurses a drink while staring intently at a board game
    infront of him. The other, an elf scholar in blue robes beckons you over with
    a seductive 'come hither' hand gesture. As you approach the table, the elf slouches
    back, kicks out a chair for you, and smiles flirtatiously.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Well,
    hello handsome! Haven't seen you around here before, where are you and your son
    from?</color> the elf asks, batting her eye lashes and twirling a finger through
    her hair. The satyr across her from smirks and snorts as he struggles to contain
    his laughter at her desperate attempt at flirtation. Feeling bad for her, you
    relieve the tension by half smiling back and insisting get the point on why she
    really called you over.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Fair enough, silver fox. With
    the imperium inquisitors snooping around, there's no legal place in the world
    for my type of magic anymore. None except the arena. You're forming a team, and
    we want in. I perfected a brand new spell the other day, I'll have you know.
    Almost turned a gnoll completely inside out with it! And Fuz here, he's the best
    archer in all the empire. I once saw him shoot the hair off a spider's ass while
    drunk! \"</color>"
