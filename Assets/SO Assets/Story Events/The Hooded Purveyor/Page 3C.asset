  pageDescription: "You know better than to do dealings with monsters: there's always
    a catch. You tell the hooded figure politely, but firmly, that your only interest
    at this current moment is getting some sleep. The hooded figure's grin softens
    slightly as it's smoking arms retreat effortlessly inside it's cloak. \n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Such
    a pity...\". </color>\n\nThe hooded figure collapses back into a pool of thick
    black smoke that covers the floor. The smoke glides underneath the door to your
    room. Just before the last of is about to leave, he hushes out a sinister whisper
    that echoes through the room.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Sweet dreams, captain...\".</color>"
