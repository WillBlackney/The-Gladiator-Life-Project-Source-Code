  pageDescription: 'Just as the figure finishes it''s pitch, {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME}
    {CHOICE_CHARACTER_SUB_NAME} jumps out of bed and points defiantly at the hooded
    figure.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"GO BACK TO THE ABYSS, FOUL BEAST!"</color>


    The
    hooded figure lets out an unnerving, hysterical laugh that echoes around the
    room. Without a moment of hesitation, {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME} lunges forward
    triumphantly and grabs the hooded figure by the head with both hands. {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME}
    starts uttering a prayer that rapidly rises to a screaming crescendo. The hooded
    figure''s laughter turns to screaching that grows so loud you are forced to your
    knees.


    As {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME} continues to yell out the prayer, the
    hooded figure writhes in agony faster and faster until it finally explodes into
    a plume of black smoke which evaporates instantly. Left behind are the two baubbles
    it brought to offer you.'
