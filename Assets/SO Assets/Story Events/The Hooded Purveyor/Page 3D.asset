  pageDescription: "Just as the figure finishes it's pitch, {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME}
    {CHOICE_CHARACTER_SUB_NAME} jumps out of bed and points defiantly at the hooded
    figure.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"GO BACK TO THE ABYSS, FOUL BEAST!\"</color>\n\nThe
    hooded figure lets out an unnerving, hysterical laugh that echoes around the
    room. Without a moment of hesitation, {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME} lunges forward
    triumphantly and grabs the hooded figure by the head with both hands, uttering
    a prayer that rapidly crescendos into a yell. The hooded figure's laughter stops,
    and it begins screeching so loud and horrifcally that you buckle to your knees
    with ear pain. \n\nAs {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME} continues to yell out the prayer,
    the hooded figure writhes in agony faster and faster until it finally explodes
    into a plume of black smoke, leaving behind only the two baubbles it brought
    to offer you."
