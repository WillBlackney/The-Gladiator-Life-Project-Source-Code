  pageDescription: 'You are laying in bed after a long day of sending people to their
    deaths, when a metallic taste begins to fill your mouth. You shiver as a cold
    chill fills the air. Sitting up, you notice plumes of thick black smoke pouring
    out of the very walls. You watch as it coalesces in the center of the room to
    form a cloaked figure. Two glowing, red eyes twinkle dangerously under it''s
    hood.


    You grab a blade from underneath your bed to defend yourself. The
    hooded figure strecthes out its hand. Suddenly the handle of the blade burns
    so hot you''re forced to drop it, wincing in pain.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"Fear
    me not, delicate fleshling. If I wanted you dead, I''d have simply waited for
    you to fall asleep, and then eaten your liver. I came to make you an offer on
    behalf of my...employer".</color>'
