  pageDescription: 'The hooded figure begins to grin. The smile grows...and grows
    until it is impossibly wide. More dark smoke billows out from his robe to form
    a left hand, smoky fingers uncurl to reveal a perfectly cut red gem with a gently
    oscilating glow


    <color=#FFFFFF>"The crystallized spirit of a jealous concubine
    who lived long before the rise of the Imperium. Perhaps, even before my time. 
    He who posseses this shall have their sword arm fueled by the envious rage of
    a lover''s scorn."</color>


    Smoke evaporates from the robes to form an arm
    once more, revealing a fairly unremarkable looking rock.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"No
    exciting mystery to go along with this one i''m afraid, ''tis simply a petrified
    wyrm egg. So well documented are it''s properites that even that insufferable
    simpleton at the library will tell you the same as I: standing near this egg
    will harden one''s flesh to cuts".</color>


    The hooded figure slowly redirects
    it''s maniacal gaze back towards you, then leans inward with a tilted head.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"Choose".</color>'
