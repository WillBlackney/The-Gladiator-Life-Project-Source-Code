  pageDescription: "Keen to be rid of your uninvited guest, you point to the object
    in the hooded figure's left hand without dwelling too much on the decision. \n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Very
    well, mortal. A fair trade.\"</color> says the hooded figure, placing the other
    object back inside his cloak.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Trade?\"</color> you ask with
    an eye brow raised.\n\nThe hooded figure tilts its head back and cackles. Suddenly
    the figure collapses into a pool of black smoke so thick it fills the room. The
    metallic taste of iron fills your mouth. The taste grows stronger and stronger
    until...it is gone, and so too is the smoke. \n\nYou see the crystalized spirit
    glowing gently on the floor, the only evidence the hooded figure was ever in
    this room. You also notice your coin purse open with a big empty space were all
    your gold used to be...Demonic bastard stole all the money!"
