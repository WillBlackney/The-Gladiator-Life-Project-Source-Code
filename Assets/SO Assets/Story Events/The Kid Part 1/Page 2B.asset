  pageDescription: "You walk over to {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME}. They
    flip a coin between their fingers. They fumble as you approach. The coin falls
    into the dust between the two of you. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"I\u2019m not one
    for games, {CHARACTER_1_NAME}. How do you want to play this?\"</color> You ask.\r\n\r\n{CHARACTER_1_NAME}
    smirks. He looks at the coin lying in the dust. <color=#FFFFFF>\"Seems I\u2019ve
    misplaced my coin. You wouldn\u2019t be able to send a little more my way, would
    you? You wouldn\u2019t want the wrong person to start digging around whatever
    you and The Kid were talking about, right?\"</color>\n\r\nThe bastard\u2019s
    trying to extort you. You could pay the slimy git now, but whose to say he won\u2019t
    ask for more in the future. What other option do you have? You look down at the
    blade in your belt loop; that\u2019s the other option."
