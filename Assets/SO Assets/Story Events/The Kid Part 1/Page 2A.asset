  pageDescription: "You're not too surprised to see Imperial Guards later that evening.
    They kick down your bedroom door and in that moment you're sure they've figured
    out The Plan. They stand meanicingly around you, hands on sword hilts before
    their captain speaks.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Whats this I hear of people wanting
    to be more powerful than the Emperor?\"</color> She says. A small quaver in her
    voice alerts you to the fact that she doesn't seem to know quite as much as you
    thought.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Thats impossible Ma'am. No one could be more
    powerful than the Emperor. Thats why we call him The Emperor; Most Powerful.\"</color>\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Yes.
    Well I heard something about some of your men wanting to be more powerful than
    him.\"</color>\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Pipe dreams, Ma'am. Kids hopped up on the
    thrill of their first battle. I'm sure you've seen it in your own recruits.\"</color>\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Yes...well...I
    suppose I have. And whats this I hear about ghosts?\"</color>\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Some
    of my fighters have their superstitions. I've not been able to assuage them.
    Try as I might.\"</color>\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Right. So you're not trying to
    overthrow the Emperor with an army of ghosts?\"</color>\n\r\nYou stay silent.
    One of the Captains men stifles a laugh. You hold your breath, trying not to
    laugh yourself. \r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"We're going to have to have a very stern
    chat with one of your men, Captain.\"</color> Says the Imperial Captain. <color=#FFFFFF>\"I'm
    sorry to say but they may not be up to fighting in the arena tomorrow. But intentional
    misinformation to an Imperial Guardsmen must be punished.\"</color>\n\r\nThey
    leave your room in a hurry. Moments later you hear {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME}
    scream in agony. For once, you can't blame the Guards. If they hadn't maimed
    {CHARACTER_1_NAME} you would have had to do it yourself."
