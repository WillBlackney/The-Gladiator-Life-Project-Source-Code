  pageDescription: "The Kid, rushes to you, covered in gore. You can\u2019t avoid
    their bloody embrace. When they finally let go, you too are dripping in remnants
    of the arena\u2019s carnage.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Did you see me!?\"</color> Asks
    The Kid. <color=#FFFFFF>\"I was unstoppable! I really felt them. All those souls;
    guiding my blade, raising my shield. I think I heard one whisper in my ear!\"</color>\n\nYou
    try to hush The Kid, but they bat your hand away.\r\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"It\u2019s
    real. I felt it. We\u2019re going to do this! That crazy old witch was right!
    If we stick to the plan, we\u2019re going to be the most powerful people this
    Empire has ever seen!\"</color>\n\nYou grab The Kid and pull them close. <color=#FFFFFF>\"So,
    watch your mouth. Cause if anything gets out, we\u2019re going to be the most
    dead people this empire has ever seen.\"</color>\r\n\nThe Kid jokingly puts a
    finger to their lips before skipping away. You notice one of your fighters standing
    a little too close and realize they\u2019ve heard every word. "
