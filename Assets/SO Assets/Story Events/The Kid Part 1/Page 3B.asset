  pageDescription: "<color=#FFFFFF>\"Loyalty is important to me. Even if I have to
    buy it.\"</color> You say leading the way to a secluded part of the town.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"You
    always struck me as a wise and generous leader.\"</color> Sneers {CHARACTER_1_NAME}
    as they follow.\r\n\r\nYou drop a heavy sack of coin before {CHARACTER_1_NAME}.
    Yellowed teeth curl into a Cheshire grin, filled with approval. <color=#FFFFFF>\"How
    much is that?\"</color> They ask.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Why don\u2019t you
    count it out for me? Make sure we\u2019re both satisfied. You\u2019re a great
    fighter {CHARACTER_1_NAME}. I don\u2019t want anything leading you away from
    our stable.\"</color>\n\r\n{CHARACTER_1_NAME} buys your charade hook, line, and
    sinker. You can almost smell the greed wafting off them as they turn their back
    to you and begin counting coins. Under the dappled light of the Breedmarsh canopy,
    your long knife flashes out. You leave {CHARACTER_1_NAME} with a second grin,
    lower than the first and far more bloody. They clutch their throat as warm blood
    oozes through their shaking fingers. \r\n\r\nYou pick up your purse of coin.
    Before it was blood money in the figurative sense. Figurative never suited you
    so much as the literal, you think as you heft the sack, still warm with {CHARACTER_1_NAME}\u2019s
    blood."
