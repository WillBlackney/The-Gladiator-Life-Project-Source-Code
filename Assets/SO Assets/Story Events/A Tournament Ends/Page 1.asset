  pageDescription: "A couple of seasoned gladiators take up residence in the tavern.\r
    Rumours quickly begin circulating about why such prized fighters would have left
    their gladatorial stable.\r\n\r\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"They mutinied and killed their
    captain!..They're demons in disguise!..They slaughtered a church of imperial
    worshippers!..\"</color>. Each rumour is more sensational than the last.\n\r\nWhen
    the truth comes out, it's much more anticlimactic: their captain had a child
    and decided to hang it all up for family time. "
