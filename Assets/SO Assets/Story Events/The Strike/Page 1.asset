  pageDescription: 'You''re heading back to your room at the end of the night when
    you''re stopped by your stable of gladiators. This must be some new joke they''ve
    cooked up. You''re beginning to get sick of their dumb jokes. You grimace and
    go to move past. None of your gladiators move.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"What''s
    the problem, lads?" </color>


    {CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME}
    sheepishly steps forward and informs you that, after a long disgruntled discussion
    with the others, they''ve reached a consensus: they all think they''re underpaid,
    and demand of you a raise. You wish this had been another one of their dumb jokes.
