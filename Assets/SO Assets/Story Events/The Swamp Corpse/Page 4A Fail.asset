  pageDescription: 'There''s no more need to be quiet. The beast knows where you
    are. You yell out to {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME} to quickly snatch the helmet and
    run like the wind. Still flat on his back from the fall, {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME}
    rolls over and crawls through the mud to the corpse. As he fumbles with the helmet''s
    chin strap, brackish marsh water begins to churn and roil.


    A huge, scaley
    fingorn emerges from the water with a roar. Powerful jaws clamp down on {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME}.
    A furious mauling follows. When it has ended, the beast slinks below the surface
    of the water leaving {CHOICE_CHARACTER_NAME} a bloody mess, indistinguishable
    from the corpse he just looted. '
