  pageDescription: 'There''s no point in staying quiet. The best knows where you
    are. You yell out to {CHARACTER_1_NAME} to grab the helmet and run like the wind.
    Still flat on his back from the fall, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} rolls over and crawls
    through the mud to the corpse. He fumbles with helmet''s chin strap as the marshwater
    begins to bubble and churn.


    {CHARACTER_1_NAME} is taking too long. Surely
    this is how they die. You''re about to yell out to them to forget the helmet
    when {CHARACTER_1_NAME} jumps to their feet holding the helmet up triumphantly.
    They run back toward you, nearly slipping and falling with every step. From dry
    ground, you reach out a hand to help them.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"Get out of my
    fucking way!"</color>{CHARACTER_1_NAME} screams as they barge past you. You turn
    and run yourself desperately trying to keep up.'
