  pageDescription: "{CHARACTER_1_NAME} {CHARACTER_1_SUB_NAME} wades out into the
    shallow, swampy water toward the dead guard. Clumsily, {CHARACTER_1_NAME} slips
    and falls into the shallows, breaking the eerie swamp silence with an echoing
    splash. \n\nA low, guttural growl reverberates through the forest. You both freeze,
    eyes darting around to locate the source of the sound. After a tense silence,
    {CHARACTER_1_NAME} lets out a sigh of relief, when suddenly\u2026\n\r\nA huge,
    scaley fingorn emerges from the brackish water with a roar. Powerful jaws clamp
    down on {CHARACTER_1_NAME}. A furious mauling follows. When it has ended, the
    beast slinks below the surface of the water leaving {CHARACTER_1_NAME} a bloody
    mess, indistinguishable from the corpse he just looted. "
