  pageDescription: "Breedmarsh is a dangerous route to accept for any trader. Most
    caravans run the risk of being ambushed and eaten whole by Fingorns, Bringorns,
    or Lunkers. However, this week, more traders than usual have reach Slimeholm
    with their goods intact. \n\r\nAs such, the overwhelming supply of new goods
    has driven down prices temporarily.\r\n"
