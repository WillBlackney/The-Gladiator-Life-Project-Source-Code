  pageDescription: '<color=#FFFFFF>"I want to hunt down and slay wyrms."</color>
    Gormak The Great replies.


    You tell Gormak that he is destined to be dissapointed:
    the wyrms are all extinct. Gormak jumps to his feet, raises his hands above his
    head, and flexes his biceps.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"BECAUSE MY BROTHER AND I KILLED
    THEM ALL! Ha ha HA!"</color> Gormak proclaims to the jeers and snorts of everyone
    else in the tavern.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"And now, without beasts to butcher,
    I find myself in search of a new challenge. I hear pray tell of your impressive
    feet...feats. Although they are only one millioneth as impressive as my own,
    your reputation doth make rumbles. Especially for someone as old, poor, and stupid
    as you. Let''s join forces together in the arena, eh? For 1000 gold, my axe is
    yours".</color>'
