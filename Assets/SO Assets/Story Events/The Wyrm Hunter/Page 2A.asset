  pageDescription: "<color=#FFFFFF>\"I want to hunt down and slay wyrms.\"</color>
    Gormak The Great replies.\n\nYou tell Gormak that he is destined to be dissapointed:
    the wyrms are all extinct. Without skipping a beat, Gormak jumps to his feet,
    raises his hands above his head, and flexes his biceps.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"BECAUSE
    MY BROTHER AND I KILLED THEM ALL! Ha ha HA!\"</color> Gormak proclaims to the
    jeers and snorts of everyone else in the tavern. \n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"And so
    now, without beasts to butcher, I find myself in search of a new challenge. I
    have heard of you and your feats, and although they are only one millioneth as
    impressive as my own, they <i>are</i> impressive, espicially for someone as old,
    poor and stupid as you. Let's join forces together in the arena, eh? For 1000
    gold, my axe is yours\".</color>"
