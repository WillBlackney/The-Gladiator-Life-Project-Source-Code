  pageDescription: "Big muscles, big tusks, and a big ego: the ideal qualities of
    a gladiator. You accept Gormak's offer, tossing him a bag of coins as his signing
    fee and sliding a mug of ale towards him. He snatches the mug before it slides
    to a stop and chugs it down quickly. Ale spills down his face and armour. He
    lets out a long <color=#FFFFFF>\"Ahhhhh\"</color> as he slams the empty mug onto
    the table.\n\n<color=#FFFFFF>\"Lok' narosh, captain. Lok' narosh! Let us deliberate
    an established protocol, eh? First, you and your men shall address me as 'Gormak
    the Great' or 'Sir Gormak.' Only ever these two, especially when discussing my
    great deeds with others. 'Gormak the God' is also acceptable. \n\nSecond, who
    is the one that shall clean my armour at the end of each day? Will it be you?
    Actually nevermind, I'll just get the squire you assign to me to do it. Third,
    i require a foot massage at the end of each day, performed by a female satyr
    no older than twenty one summers. I'll also require someone to carry my baggage.
    Third:...No fourth. Or was it fifth?..\".</color>\n\nOne by one, you and the
    men stop paying attention and go back to drinking and joking. Gormak, clearly
    in love with the sound of his own voice, doesn't even notice."
