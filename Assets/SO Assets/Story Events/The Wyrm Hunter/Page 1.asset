  pageDescription: 'Fresh off the heels of an arena victory, you head to the tavern
    with your gladiators to celebrate and relax. The atmosphere in the tavern is
    euphoric and wild. Your men drink and jest with patrons who toast them while
    buying them round after round.


    he euphoria comes to an abrupt halt as the
    tavern door screeches open. An intimidatingly large Orc stands in the doorway,
    his hulking mass fills out the entire frame., His eyes, a killers eyes, survey
    the room.


    <color=#FFFFFF>"Hail! It is I: Gormak The Great!"</color>, he
    declares with a prideful smile and bouncing eyebrows. It seems he expects you
    to know who he is...'
